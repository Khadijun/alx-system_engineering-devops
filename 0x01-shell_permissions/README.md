File Permissions
On a Linux system, each file and directory is assigned access rights for the owner of the file, the members of a group of related users, and everybody else. Rights can be assigned to read a file, to write a file, and to execute a file (i.e., run the file as a program).

commands involved:
chmod
sudo
su
chown
chgrp
id
groups
whoami
adduser
useradd
addgroup
